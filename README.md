Free YouTube Video Playlist Downloader

Attention Please

I hope you are all doing well.

As we all know that, YouTube is the best video application, and everyone from you always wants to download videos from the youtube, as there are are many websites and softwares which allows us to download a single video from the youtube but when we talked about the youtube playlist there is no such proper software which help us to download entire playlist on a single click, as there are many web based and desktop applications like IDM, but most of them are paid and after cracking those softwares sometimes we may face some issues, so, to overcome this issue i have developed a simple software named as "Royal Downloader" which will help you to download the entire playlist from any youtube channel on a single click.
Note: I am not encouraging piracy, as the content creator on Youtube is doing a great job and working hard, and there is no purpose to D-Grade their work. The main purpose of this application is to help those students who want to learn from YouTube but, due to network issues or electricity issues, are not able to watch the videos properly. This application helps those students download those lectures when they get proper network access and learn properly through downloaded videos.

One more thing is that when you people complete your courses and start earning, just pay tribute to those channels from where you downloaded their lectures. For that, just watch their videos and pay tribute, as they are our mentors.
